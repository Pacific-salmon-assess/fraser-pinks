# fraser-pinks
Analysis of Fraser River pink salmon spawner recruitment observations with state-space model to account for time varying observation error in estimates of spawning escapement and harvest. Ultimate goal of analysis is to derive biological benchmarks to inform a Limit Reference Point for the Stock Management Unit and associated harvest control rule.
